Find the smallest integer not less than the given limit which is divisible by
at least one integer from the given array.

Example

For divisors = [2, 3, 4] and start = 13, the output should be
firstMultiple2(divisors, start) = 14.


int firstMultiple2(int[] divisors, int start) {
    for (int i : divisors)
        if (start % i == 0)
            return start;
    return firstMultiple2(divisors, ++start);
}
