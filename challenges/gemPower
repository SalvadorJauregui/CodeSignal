Water and fire are two elements that bring great power. 
There are water gem (W), fire gem (F) and non-elemental gem (N). 
The magician wants to put it into a sequence of length n to create a super power. 
However, two fire gems can not placed side by side, two water gems can not placed 
side by side because it will not be able to control. Non-elemental gem can be placed 
anywhere and placed side by side.
Because this result can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Example
For n = 2, the output should be
gemPower(n) = 7.
These are: FN, FW, WF, WN, NF, NW, NN.



int gemPower(int n){
    int m = 1000000007;    
    int a1 = 3;   
    int a2 = 7;
    int a3 = 0;
    
    if (n == 1)
        return 3;
    
    if (n == 2)
        return 7;
    
    while (n-- > 2){
        a3 = ((a2 * 2)%m+(a1)%m)%m;
        a1 = a2;
        a2 = a3;
    }
   return a3;
}
