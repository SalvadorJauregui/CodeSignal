Some phone usage rate may be described as follows:

first minute of a call costs min1 cents,
each minute from the 2nd up to 10th (inclusive) costs min2_10 cents
each minute after 10th costs min11 cents.
You have s cents on your account before the call. What is the duration of the longest call (in minutes rounded down to the nearest integer) you can have?

Example

For min1 = 3, min2_10 = 1, min11 = 2, and s = 20, the output should be
phoneCall(min1, min2_10, min11, s) = 14.


/***** SOLUTION *****/
int phoneCall(int min1, int min2_10, int min11, int s) {
    final int SECOND_BATCH = 9;
    int totalMinutes = 1;
    
    /* First minute */
    if (s >= min1){
        s-=min1;
    }else
        return 0;
    
    /* Second batch */
    if (s >= min2_10 * SECOND_BATCH){
        s-= min2_10 * SECOND_BATCH;
        totalMinutes+=SECOND_BATCH;
    }else
        return totalMinutes + s / min2_10;
    
    /* Third batch */
    return totalMinutes + s / min11;
}
