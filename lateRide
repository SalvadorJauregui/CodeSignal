One night you go for a ride on your motorcycle. At 00:00 you start your engine, and the built-in timer automatically
begins counting the length of your ride, in minutes. Off you go to explore the neighborhood.

When you finally decide to head back, you realize there's a chance the bridges on your route home are up,
eaving you stranded! Unfortunately, you don't have your watch on you and don't know what time it is.
All you know thanks to the bike's timer is that n minutes have passed since 00:00.

Using the bike's timer, calculate the current time. Return an answer as the sum of digits that the digital
timer in the format hh:mm would show.

Example

For n = 240, the output should be
lateRide(n) = 4.

Since 240 minutes have passed, the current time is 04:00. The digits sum up to 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 4, which is the answer.

For n = 808, the output should be
lateRide(n) = 14.

808 minutes mean that it's 13:28 now, so the answer should be 1 + 3 + 2 + 8 = 14.


/***** SOLUTION 1 *****/
int lateRide(int n) {
     /* Sum minutes and seconds */    
    return sumDigits(n / 60) + sumDigits(n % 60);
}

public static int sumDigits(int n){
    int digit = 0;
    
    while(n > 0){
        digit += n % 10;
        n /= 10;
    }   
    return digit;
}


/***** SOLUTION 2 *****/
int lateRide(int n) {
    int hour = n%60;
    int minute = n/60;
    return hour/10 + hour%10 + minute/10 + minute%10;
}
