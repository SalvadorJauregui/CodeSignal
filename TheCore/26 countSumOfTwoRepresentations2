Given integers n, l and r, find the number of ways to represent n as a sum of two integers A and B such that l ≤ A ≤ B ≤ r.
Example

For n = 6, l = 2, and r = 4, the output should be
countSumOfTwoRepresentations2(n, l, r) = 2.


/***** Solution *****/
int countSumOfTwoRepresentations2(int n, int l, int r) {
    return Math.max(n/2+1-Math.max(l, Math.max(n-r,0)),0);
}
