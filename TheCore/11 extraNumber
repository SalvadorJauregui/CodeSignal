You're given three integers, a, b and c. It is guaranteed that two of these integers are equal to each other. What is the value of the third integer?

Example

For a = 2, b = 7, and c = 2, the output should be
extraNumber(a, b, c) = 7.

The two equal numbers are a and c. The third number (b) equals 7, which is the answer.

/***** SOLUTION *****/
int extraNumber(int a, int b, int c) {
  return a ^ b ^ c;
}
