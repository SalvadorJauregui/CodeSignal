Consider an arithmetic expression of the form a#b=c. Check whether it is possible to replace # with one of the four signs: +, -, * or / to obtain a correct expression.

Example

For a = 2, b = 3, and c = 5, the output should be
arithmeticExpression(a, b, c) = true.

/***** SOLUTION *****/
boolean arithmeticExpression(int a, int b, int c) {
    return (a+b==c || a-b==c || a*b==c || c*b==a);
}
