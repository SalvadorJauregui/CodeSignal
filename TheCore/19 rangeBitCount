You are given two numbers a and b where 0 ≤ a ≤ b. Imagine you construct an array of all the integers
from a to b inclusive. You need to count the number of 1s in the binary representations of all the numbers in the array.


/***** SOLUTION 1 *****/
int rangeBitCount(int a, int b) {
    int c = 0, count = 0;
    
    for (; a<=b; a++){
        c = a;        
        while(c > 0){
            if((c & 0x1) == 1)
                ++count;
            c>>=1;
        }
    }
    return count;
}


/***** SOLUTION 2 *****/
int rangeBitCount(int a, int b) {
    int c = 0;
    for (int i = a; i<=b; i++) {
        c += Integer.bitCount(i);
    }
    return c;
}
