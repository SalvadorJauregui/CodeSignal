Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away, there lived a King Byteasar I.
As a kind and wise ruler, he did everything in his (unlimited) power to make
life for his subjects comfortable and pleasant. One cold evening a messenger
arrived at the king's castle with the latest news: all kings in the Kingdoms
Union had started enforcing traffic laws! In order to not lose his membership
in the Union, King Byteasar decided he must do the same within his kingdom.
But what would the citizens think of it?

The king decided to start introducing the changes with something more or less simple: 
change all the roads in the kingdom from two-directional to one-directional (one-way).
He personally prepared the roadRegister of the new roads, and now he needs to make sure
that the road system is convenient and there will be no traffic jams, i.e. each city has
the same number of incoming and outgoing roads. As the Hand of the King, you're the one who
he has decreed must check his calculations.


/***** SOLUTION *****/
boolean newRoadSystem(boolean[][] roadRegister) {
   
   for (int i = 0; i < roadRegister.length; i++){
      if (validCross(i, roadRegister) == false)
         return false;
   }
   return true;
}

public static boolean validCross(int index, boolean[][] roadRegister){
   
   int row = 0, col = 0;
   for (int x = 0; x < roadRegister.length; x++){
      if (roadRegister[x][index] == true)
         ++row;
      if (roadRegister[index][x] == true)
         ++col;
   }
   if (row != col)
      return false;
   return true;   
}
